# Simple calculator using MathJS

## What
A very basic calculator that concats input from key clicks and evaluates using the MathJS library. 

## Why
To keep React practice up while working at a place that is all and only jQuery (in 2020!). By using the MathJS libaray and not keeping track of  prev and curr inputs in state, I can focus on just passing props, styling, and — in 2020 — keeping it simple while chaos abounds.

## What I'd do next
I do not like that 9/0 evaluates to infinity but 9/3-3 evaluates to 0. However, this will lead to another go of making a calculator without MathJS. 

## Tools:
* ReactJS / Create React App ... or CRApp
* MathJS
* Styled Components
